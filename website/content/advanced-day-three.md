1. As you would remember, we  asked you to write the *Point* class in Python. 
This class represents a point on the cartesian plane. Think about what 
attributes you need for this class, then complete the constructor and the methods.
Let's see what the structure and the methods are for this class

        #!python
        class Point:

            # what arguments does the constructor take?
            def __init__(self):
                pass

            def distance_to(self, p):
                """
                Returns the distance between this point and another point,
                p using the distance formula
                """
                pass
            
            def midpoint(self, p):
                """
                Calculates the midpoint of p and this point.
                NOTE: This function must return a new point
                """
                pass
