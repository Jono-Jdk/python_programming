Ok, so as promised here is the website. You can expect more 
exercises to be uploaded in the next hour.


Problems
--------
1. Write a function called *printn* that has the following signature
and does what is described in the doc string.

        #!python
        def printn(string, count):
            """Prints the string `string`, `count` number of times.
               For example,

               >>> printn('Hello', 3)
               Hello
               Hello
               Hello
            """
            pass

2. Write a function *array_sum* that takes two lists of the same length
   as arguments, and returns a list that that is the element-wise 
   sum of the two lists.

        #!python
        def array_sum(list1, list2):
            """Takes two lists and returns a new list that is the 
               element-wise sum of the lists.

               For example,
               >>> array_sum([1,2,3], [1,2,3])
               [2, 4, 6]
            """
            pass

Using pass inside a function
-----
You'll see that I used *pass* in the above functions.
That just tells python that there is nothing to do inside this function.
So when you actually write your solutions, you can remove pass and then
write your solution.


Next problems coming in a bit..
